## 📖 Project Description

This project is a clean and functional mortgage calculator. It provides a user-friendly interface for potential home buyers or borrowers to quickly estimate their monthly payments.

The application takes the loan amount, the annual interest rate, and the loan term in years as inputs, then performs the necessary calculations to display the resulting monthly payment.

### Core Features

* **Input Form:** Allows users to enter:
    * Total Loan Amount
    * Annual Interest Rate (%)
    * Loan Term (in years)
* **Real-time Calculation:** A "Calculate" button processes the inputs and instantly displays the result.
* **Result Display:** Clearly shows the calculated monthly payment.
* **Form Validation:** (Assumed) Includes basic validation to ensure all fields are filled correctly with numeric values.
* **Responsive Design:** The layout is designed to be accessible and usable on various screen sizes, including mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This project was built using core front-end technologies:

* **HTML5:** For the semantic structure, primarily the input form and the results container.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, layout, and making the interface clean and responsive.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):**
    * To capture user input from the form.
    * To perform the mortgage calculation (using the standard amortization formula).
    * To dynamically update the DOM to display the calculated result.
